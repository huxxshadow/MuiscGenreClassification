# Music Genre Classification Project

## Introduction
This project is used for the automatic classification of music genres, using various machine learning models to identify and classify music files.

## 1. Environment Settings
To run this project, install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install librosa
pip install thinkx
pip install scikit-learn-intelex
pip install seaborn
pip install optuna
```

## 2. Prepare Dataset
In the `SimpleData/train` directory, we have prepared a training dataset featuring 10 types of music: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, and rock. To better mimic human auditory perception, run the following to generate Mel spectrograms for visualization of all music types:
```bash
run dataVisualization.ipynb
```

## 3. Choose Best Model
To compare the performance of various classifiers such as SGD classifier, decision tree classifier, KNN classifier, random forest classifier, and linear support vector machine classifier, execute:
```bash
run MachineLearning.ipynb
```

## 4. Evaluation
To evaluate the model, place any music file you wish to classify in `/MusicGenreClassification/input`. Then, assess the model's performance by running:
```bash
run FinalTool.ipynb
```
